==============

Find out what kind of triangle you've got! Built with Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS3, this calculator was built during the first week of [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com), then added to Github later in the course. 

You can try it out over [here](http://geneevesco.site44.com/triangleoracle/triangle.html) or clone it and open the triangle.html file in your browser.
